# MuonTube. Geiger based muon detector for art and science. 
In this project I aim to design and develop a standalone muon detector based on Geiger tubes. The proposed geometry is shown bellow:

# Roadmap:
1. Power supply design (We are here)
2. Data acquisition design.
3. Mechanical design.
4. Integration.

I intend to use custom electronics for the PSU and DAQ. Most likely driven by an FPGA.
