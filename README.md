# MuonTube. Geiger based muon detector for art and science. 
In this project I aim to design and develop a standalone muon detector based on Geiger tubes. The proposed geometry is shown bellow:

# Roadmap:
1. Power supply design. 
2. Data acquisition design. (We are here)
3. Mechanical design.
4. Integration.

I intend to use custom electronics for the PSU and DAQ. Most likely driven by an FPGA. 
PDF for the PSU and the bias circuit for the GM tube now available [here](https://github.com/sergey-negrashov/muon-tube/raw/master/Schematics/PSU.pdf)
